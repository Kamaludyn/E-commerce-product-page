## Overview

This is a complete responsive and interactive e-commerce product page with a dropdown menu, hamburger menu and a lightbox gallery

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Built with

### What I learned

During the course of building this project i learn how to make a interactive lightbox gallery

### Continued development

I'll continue working on real life projects like this one and even bigger ones, and i'll love to collaborate with anyone on exciting projects that will challenge my knowledge of javascript.
